# Welcome to PureIcons.css:

This is a library of icons rendered purely in CSS and compiled using SASSs.

It is currently at 79 icons.  More will be added as we go along.

To get started, download the source code and run the "index.html" file.  This will see all of the icons available.

All of the CSS compiled from the SASS is in "src/pureicons.scss".

If you want to change the size of the icons, go to "src/_foundation/_styles.css" and changed the "$size" variable.  Remember to go up/down in the usual icon sizes (8, 16, 32, 64, etc).
